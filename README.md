Solvent Salaries
================
When will a city go bankrupt?

#### Resolved
Salaries are inflexible and difficult for a city to cut or decrease

#### Proposed
Salaries as a percentage of the budget are a signal for the economic state city.

#### Approach
Using data from [OpenGov](www.opengov.com) we assembled budgetary data on 43 cities across a timeseries of 5.5 years. Due to the *OpenGov* API city data was broken into two parts, the graph which contained identification information for a given entity type and the data itself which was mapped to meta information from the graph.
